# Story of Stasis

Start off in the winter, your guy is cold. He knows how to shoot ice for some reason. The more he shoots ice, the colder he gets.
The colder you get the more damage your ice does. 
There are other types of enemies though -- lightning, fire, and earth, that have resistance and weaknessess to ice.
As the game progresses you have the ability to learn the other types and become more effective with those. Whichever is up to you though.

You feel the gravity changes out of nowhere.

You read about the 4 stones (lightning, fire, earth, ice) and how each of them maintain the worlds homeostasis
Put two and two together, somebody stole the stones. That explains the shift in gravity.. its getting lesser and lesser

All of the stones are gone after a few levels. Youre literally fighting in zero gravity, flying, teleporting, and shooting elements

You get to earths core, kill the guy with the stones, and put them back.

Cool, gravity is back to normal.
